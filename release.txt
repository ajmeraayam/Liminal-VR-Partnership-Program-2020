There are 3 tasks that we haven't included in this release. The tasks/ideas were optional and were not necessarily impacting the main functionalities that are currently implemented in the current product.

The tasks that were left out are:
1. When clicked on an item during animation of some ingredient, record that click and execute it later. 
2. Recipe changes can be salient (give some indication that the recipe has changed).
3. Create floating potion animation whenever the successful brew is finished.
